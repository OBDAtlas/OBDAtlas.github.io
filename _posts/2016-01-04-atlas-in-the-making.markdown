Hello fellow readers, this is our first short conversation with you. Atlas was started because we believe that the information in your car should be open for you to take part in and deal with. There are a bunch of websites out there already but we hope to be the main hub for your future maintainance of your car and OBD hacking by providing open source documentation about all we know an learn. You can see our github site by following the link in the page footer.

Happy to see you, we look forward to your next visit :)
