<p>
  Mode 03 is used to request trouble codes from the ECU. You cannot provide any
  pid together with this mode. After querying this pid you will receive either
  one response frame if only one or two DTCs have been logged or multiple frames
  for three or more DTCs until all have been listed.<br>
  <br>
  A DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) consists of two bytes resulting in a five
  character trouble code and can be deciphered using the table below.
