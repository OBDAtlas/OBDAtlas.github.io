<p>
  Mode 05 is used to query the O2 (oxygen / lambda) sensors in your car. Briefly, an O2 sensor is
  a small device that measure the emissions from the engine to detect if the
  mixture of air and fuel is the right mixture. If it isn't, your ___ cannot r
  emove the hazardous particles left over from the combustion in your engine.<br>
  <br>
  Electically an O2 sensor is reporting a voltage value back to the ECU in your
  car which is later interpreted as a decimal value. In perfect conditions this
  value is 1.0 and is allowed to fluctuate a few percent based on your country's
  rules regarding vehicle emissions. A value grater than 1 indicates that your
  car injects more fuel than it should (rich) and a value lower than 1 indicates
  too much oxygen in the mixture (lean).<br>
  <br>
  Running your engine rich is typically bad for your catalytic converter, causes
  a higher fuel consumption and in some cases lower power output from your
  engine. If your O2 sensor is really bad you could even soak your spark plugs.<br>
  <br>
  If you suspect that your O2 sensor is making your car run bad you could unplug
  the component and see if your car runs better. A car is capable of operating
  without O2 sensors but it will not get the fine trimming data that
  keeps your engine, catalyst and other components working efficiently. The O2
  sensor is not even used the first minute up to a couple of minutes in colder
  conditions because it needs to reach operating temperatures before giving
  correct data. Modern O2 sensors include a pre-heating element to shorten the
  time it takes before it is activated.
